B-4.c
----------------

        1   How many  times is the expression  (a + c) computed  in the original
            code (as seen in the SSA pass)? What about after the FRE pass?
	ans1. It is calculated 2 times in ssa. It is calculated only once in FRE.
        2   Have  there been  any more  optimizations  after FRE?  How will  you
            check?
	ans2. The final optimized file is with .optimized extension. We can check that file to see if there are any other optimizations.
        3   Why did  we have  to put a  "return b" in  this assignment?  What if
            "return b" is changed to "return 0"? Will it make any difference?
	ans3. If we dont return b then the piece of code would not be useful and we wont be able to get the value of the calculation performed by the code.
