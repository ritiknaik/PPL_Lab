        1   Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
            suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables
            have a suffix `(D)'?
	ans1. Yes we can trace the suffix back to its assignment. Maybe (D) is because c is not declared before using it in the if condition.
        2   Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments
            to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice  that PHI statements
            have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI
            statements?
	ans2. The syntax of PHI statements looks like PHI<name1(bb), name2(bb)...> where name is the variable name and bb is the block where it is declared.        
	3   Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two
            versions of a variable?
	ans3.
