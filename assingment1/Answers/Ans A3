        1   Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
            the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?
	ans1. bb 3 and bb4  correspond to the while loop. 
        2   Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
            able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
            loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
            special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?
	ans2. bb 5:  variable initialisation of outer loop
   	      bb 10: checking condition of outer loop 
   	      bb 6:  variable initialisation of inner loop
  	      bb 8:  checking condition of inner loop 
	      bb 7:  inner loop body and variable increment
	      bb 9:  outer loop variable increment
