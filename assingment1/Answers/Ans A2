A-2.c
---------------------------

        1   How have if-blocks  been translated into GIMPLE  statements? Can you
            differentiate between conditional and unconditional gotos?
	ans1. If blocks are translated into goto statements and goto blocks are assigned depending on the condition in the code. 
        2   Repeat  the  above compilation,  but  now  asking for  another  dump
            that  of  the pass  "cfg".  View  this  pass  and say  whether  this
            representation makes it easier to  read and understand GIMPLEs. Draw
            the control-flow graph  of the program A-2.c on a  piece of paper by
            looking at the CFG dump.

            Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-cfg A-2.c
            View result : vi -O A-2.c A-2.c.*.cfg
        ans2. It is easier to see the control flow looking at cfg dump.
