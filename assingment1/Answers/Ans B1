B-1.c
-------------

        1   The body  of AddTwo(x)  seems to  be inlined into  the call  of main
            rendering the function useless (nobody else is calling it). Then why
            is the definition of AddTwo(x) still there all the way till the last
            pass (B-1.c.*.optimized)?
	ans1. It cannot be discarded as it can be called again later. 
        2   Is there any way to get rid of it?
	ans2.
